**Avoid Floating Pragma Unless Creating Libraries**  

**Issue:**  
The contract uses a floating pragma: `pragma solidity ^0.8.19`. This can lead to unexpected issues due to subtle differences in compiler versions. While floating pragmas are suitable for libraries, they should be avoided in contracts to ensure consistency and predictability.

**Recommendation:**  
I recommend fixing the compiler version to a specific one, like `0.8.19`. This will enhance stability and prevent compatibility issues with future compiler releases, aligning with security best practices outlined in SWC-103.

**Current Code:**  
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
```

**Suggested Fix:**  
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.19;
```
